									<h2 class="major">Words are not enought to describe u yrr...</h2>
									<p>You're the person who has never left my life, you've been my constant in a world where everyone leaves. You've always cared for my well-being and happiness and have never given up on me, which I appreciate. As always, you're selfless, open, honest and never afraid to call me out, which is what I love about you. Being friends, it’s important to be real with each other and tell each other anything that's on our minds. We have been friends for long enough that we are so used to telling each other everything that it's weird if we don't tell each other something but feels safe and free to say anything with you...... </p>
